**Question self-test**

Please first follow the steps below to see if the issue is resolved:

1. Search the issue's keywords in this repository's issues list to see if it has already been reported.
2. Check the log displayed at the top of the webpage by the downloader (if any), and check if it shows the reason for the problem. For example: If the downloader's crawl result count is 0, it may be because your crawl settings excluded some works, and at this time the downloader will display the specific reason.
3. If your browser is not up to date, please update it.
4. If your extension is not up to date, please update it.
5. Try refreshing the tab or restarting your browser.

Before you report a bug, please make sure you have performed the above checks.
